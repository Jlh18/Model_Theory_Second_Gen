\section{Types}
This section mainly follows material from Tent and Ziegler's book \cite{tent}.
\subsection{Types on theories}
\begin{dfn}[$F(\Si,n)$ and formulas consistent with a theory]
    \link{dfn_types_on_theories}
    Let ${v_1,\dots v_n}$ be variables,
    $T$ be a $\Si$-theory.
    Let $F(\Si,n)$ be the set of $\Si$-formulas with at most 
    $v_1,\dots v_n$ as their free variables.
    For any $c \in \const{\Si}^n$, $p \subs F(\Si,n)$
    we write 
    \[p(c) = \set{\phi(c) \st \phi \in p}\]
    and if $\MM$ is a $\Si$-structure with $a \in {\MM}^n$ we write 
    \[\MM \model{\Si} p(a)\]
    to mean for every $\phi \in p$, $\MM \model{\Si} \phi(a)$.

    We say $p$ is a maximal (or complete) if for any $\phi \in F(\Si,n)$,
    $\phi \in p$ or $\NOT \phi \in p$.
    This generalises the notion of maximality (completeness) of a theory.
\end{dfn}

\begin{dfn}[Consistency for types and compactness for types]
    \link{equiv_def_of_consistent_with_theory}
    \link{compactness_for_types}
    Let $T$ be a $\Si$-theory and $p$ be a subset of $F(\Si,n)$.
    Let $c_1,\dots,c_n$ be new constant symbols and let $\Si(c)$ be 
    the signature with these added constant symbols.
    The following are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $T \cup p(c)$ is a consistent $\Si(c)$-theory.
            (Where $p(c)$ is the formulas of $p$ with the variables substituted 
            by $c_1,\dots,c_n$.)
        \item (Consistent with $T$) There exists 
            $\MM \model{\Si} T$ and $a \in {\MM}^n$
            such that $\MM \modelsi p(a)$. 
        \item (Finitely consistent with $T$) 
            For any finite subset $\De \subs p$, there exists 
            $\MM \model{\Si} T$ and $a \in {\MM}^n$
            such that $\MM \modelsi p(a)$. 
    \end{enumerate}
    If any of the above is true then we say $p$ is consistent with $T$ and say 
    $p$ is an $n$-type on $T$ since there are up to $n$ variables in the 
    formulas of $p$.
    The second and third definitions being equivalent is the generalisation 
    of compactness for $n$-types.
\end{dfn}
\begin{proof}
    ($1. \iff 2.$) 
    \begin{forward}
        Suppose we have a $\Si(c)$-structure 
        $\MM \model{\Si(c)} T \cup p(c)$.
        Then by taking the images of the interpretation of each $c_i$ in $\MM$
        we obtain $a = \modintp{\MM}{c} \in {\MM}^n$ such that 
        $\MM \model{\Si(c)} p(a)$.
        \linkto{move_down_mod}{Moving this down to $\Si$} preserves 
        satisfaction of $p(a)$  as elements of $p(a)$ are $\Si$-formulas
        with values in $\MM$ (and $T$ for the same reason):
        \[\MM \model{\Si} T \cup p(a)\]
        and we have what we want.
    \end{forward}

    \begin{backward}
        Suppose we have $\MM \model{\Si} T$ and $a \in {\MM}^n$
        such that $\MM \modelsi p(a)$.
        We can make $\MM$ a $\Si(c)$-structure such that 
        everything from $\Si$ is interpreted in the same way 
        and each constant symbol $c_i$ is interpreted as $a_i$.
        Thus \linkto{move_up_mod}{$\MM \model{\Si(c)} T$} and for any 
        $\phi(c) \in p(c)$,
        \[\MM \model{\Si} \phi(a) \implies \MM \model{\Si(c)} \phi(a)
        \implies \MM \model{\Si(c)} \phi(c)\]
        as $c$ is interpreted as $a$.
        Hence $\MM \model{\Si(c)} T \cup p(c)$ 
        and $T \cup p(c)$ is consistent in $\Si(c)$.
    \end{backward}

    ($2. \iff 3.$) 
    \begin{align*}
        &p \text{ consistent with } T \\
        &\iff T \cup p(c) \text{ consistent in } \Si(c) 
        \quad \text{by (1. $\iff$ 2.)}\\
        &\iff \text{for any finite } \De(c) \subs p(c), 
        T \cup \De(c) \text{ consistent in } \Si(c) 
        \quad \text{by \linkto{compactness}{compactness}}\\
        &\iff \text{for any finite } \De \subs p, 
        T \cup \De(c) \text{ consistent in } \Si(c) \\
        &\iff \text{for any finite } \De \subs p, 
        \De \text{ consistent with } T
        \quad \text{by (1. $\iff$ 2.)}
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[Stone space of a theory]
    Let $T$ be a $\Si$-theory.
    Let the stone space of $T$, 
    $S_n(T)$ be the set of all maximal $n$-types on $T$.
    (The signature of the $n$-types of the on $T$ is implicit, 
    given by the signature of $T$.)
    We give a topology on $S_n(T)$ by specifying an open basis;
    $U \subs S_n(T)$ is an element of the basis when there exists 
    $\phi \in F(\Si,n)$ such that 
    \[U = [\phi]_T := \set{p \in S_n(T) \st \phi \in p}\]
\end{dfn}

\begin{prop}[Extending to maximal $n$-types (Zorn)]
    \link{extend_to_maximal_type_zorn}
    Any $n$-type can be extended to a maximal $n$-type.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Let $T$ be a theory and $p$ be a $n$-type.
    Order by inclusion the set
    \[ 
        Z = \set{q \in S_n(T) \st q \text{ is an } n\text{-type and }
        p \subs q}
    \]
    This is non-empty as it contains $p$.
    Let $p_0 \subs p_1 \subs \dots$ be a chain in $Z$.
    Then $m = \bigcup_{i \in \N} p_i$ is finitely consistent with $T$
    (by taking large enough $i$)
    \linkto{compactness_for_types}{hence} consistent with $T$. 
    By Zorn we have the existence of a maximal element $q$ in $Z$.
    To show that $q$ is a maximal $n$-type let $\phi \in F(\Si,n)$. 
    As $q$ is consistent with $T$ there exists a $\Si$-structure 
    $\MM \model{\Si} T$ and $a \in {\MM}^n$ such that 
    $\MM \model{\Si} q(a)$. 
    In the case that $\MM \model{\Si} \phi(a)$
    we have $q \cup \set{\phi}$ is consistent with $T$ and so by 
    maximality $\phi \in q$.
    In the other case $q \cup \set{\NOT \phi}$ is consistent and so
    $\NOT \phi \in q$.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[Equivalence modulo a theory]
    \link{dfn_modulo_theory}
    We say two $\Si$-formulas $\phi$ and $\psi$ with 
    free variables indexed by $S$ are equivalent modulo a 
    $\Si$-theory $T$ if 
    \[T \model{\Si} \forall v, \brkt{\phi \iff \psi}\]
    where $v = (v_i)_{i \in S}$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prop}[Basic facts about the basis elements]
    \link{basic_facts_basis_elems}
    Let $T$ be a $\Si$-theory, $\phi, \psi \in F(\Si,n)$.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $(\NOT \phi) \in p$ if and only if $p \notin [\psi]_T$.
        \item $[\phi]_T = [\psi]_T$ if and only if $\phi$ and $\psi$ are 
            equivalent modulo $T$.

        The basis elements are closed under Boolean operations
        \item $[\NOT \phi]_T = S_n(T) \setminus [\phi]_T$
        \item $[\phi \OR \psi]_T = [\phi]_T \cup [\psi]_T$
        \item $[\phi \AND \psi]_T = [\phi]_T \cap [\psi]_T$
        \item $[\top]_T = S_n(T)$ and $[\bot]_T = \nothing$
    \end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    We will just prove a couple of these.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Suppose $(\NOT \phi) \in p$.
            Then if $p \in [\phi]_T$ then since $p$ is consistent with $T$
            there exists a model $\MM$ and $a$ from 
            $\MM$ such that
            $\MM \modelsi \phi(a)$ and $\MM \nodel{\Si} \phi(a)$, 
            a contradiction.
            For the other direction, 
            $p \notin [\psi]_T$ and so $ \psi \notin p$ and
            by maximality $\NOT \phi \in p$.
        \item \begin{forward}
            Suppose for a contradiction
            $T \nodel{\Si} \forall v, \brkt{\phi \iff \psi}$.
            then \linkto{not_a_consequence}{there 
            exists $\MM \model{\Si} T$} and $a \in {\MM}^n$ such that 
            $\MM \modelsi \phi \AND \NOT \psi$ or 
            $\MM \modelsi (\NOT \phi) \AND \psi$.
            In the first case we have that $\set{\phi, \NOT \psi}$ 
            is consistent with $T$ and so can be 
            \linkto{extend_to_maximal_type_zorn}{extended
            to a maximal $n$-type $p$}.
            Thus $p \in [\phi]_T = [\psi]_T$ and $p \notin [\psi]_T$, 
            a contradiction.
            \end{forward}
            \begin{backward}
                Suppose $T \model{\Si} \forall v, \brkt{\phi \iff \psi}$.
                Let $p \in [\phi]_T$.
                It suffices to show that $p \in [\psi]_T$.
                Since $p$ is consistent with $T$ there exists a $\Si$-structure
                $\MM \model{\Si} T$ and $a \in {\MM}^n$ such that 
                $\MM \model{\Si} p(a)$.
                By assumption $\MM \model{\Si} \brkt{\phi \iff \psi}(a)$
                and $p \in [\phi]_T$ so 
                $\MM \model{\Si} \psi(a)$.
                Suppose $p \notin \psi$, then $\NOT \psi \in p$ hence 
                we have a contradiction.
            \end{backward}
        \item $p \in [\phi \OR \psi]_T$ if and only if 
            $(\phi \OR \psi) \in p$. 
            Suppose $\phi \notin p$ then by maximality 
            $(\NOT \phi) \in p$ and so $p \in [\psi]_T$. 
            In the other case $p \in [\phi]_T$.
            For the other direction $p \in [\phi]_T \cup [\psi]_T$
            implies $\phi \in p$ or $\psi \in p$.
            In the first case we have $\MM \model{\Si} T$ such that 
            $\MM \model{\Si} \phi$.
            Then $\MM \model{\Si} \phi \OR \psi$ and so $(\phi \OR \psi) \in p$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Properties of the Stone space]
    \link{properties_of_stone_space}
    Let $T$ be a theory.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Elements of the basis of $S_n(T)$ are clopen.
        \item $S_n(T)$ is Hausdorff.
        \item $S_n(T)$ is compact.
    \end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}~
\begin{itemize}
    \item By maximality of each $p$ the complement of $U$ is also 
        in the open basis:
        \[  
            \set{p \in S_n(T) \st \phi \notin p}
            = \set{p \in S_n(T) \st (\NOT \phi) \in p}
        \]
        Hence each element of the basis is clopen.
    \item Let $p,q \in S_n(T)$ and suppose $p \ne q$. 
        By maximality and the fact that $\form{\Si}$ is non-empty we can assume
        without loss of generality that there is $\phi \in p \setminus q$.
        Again by maximality $(\NOT \phi) \in q$, 
        and so $p \in [\phi], q \in [\NOT \phi]_T$.
        These opens are disjoint:
        if $r \in [\phi]_T \cap [\NOT \phi]_T$ then as 
        $r$ is consistent with $T$, there exists 
        $\MM \model{\Si} T$ such that 
        $\MM \model{\Si} \phi$ and $\MM \model{\Si}(\NOT \phi)$
        a contradiction. 
    \item Naturally we will use the
        \linkto{compactness_for_types}{compactness theorem for types}.
        Let $C$ be a collection of closed sets with finite intersection
        property.
        Then each closed set can be written as an intersection of
        basis elements (a finite union of closed sets is still a basis element
        since \linkto{basic_facts_basis_elems}{$[\phi]\cup[\psi]_T = 
            [\phi \OR \psi]_T$}):
        \[C = \set{\bigcap_{\phi \in \al}[\phi]_T \st \al \in I}\]
        Let 
        \[\Ga = \set{\phi \in \al \st \al \in I} \quad 
        \text{ and } \quad [\Ga]_T = \set{[\phi]_T \st \phi \Ga}\]
        Then the intersection any finite subset of $[\Ga]_T$ is non-empty as it
        contains a finite intersection of elements in $C$.
        Thus for any finite subset $\De \subs \Ga$ 
        there exists $p \in S_n(T)$ such that $\De \subs p$,
        and as $p$ is consistent with $T$ so is $\De$.
        Hence $\Ga$ is finitely consistent with $T$ and so
        \linkto{compactness_for_types}{$\Ga$ is consistent with $T$}.
        \linkto{extend_to_maximal_type_zorn}{Extending $\Ga$ to a 
        maximal $n$-type} $q$ gives us $\phi \in q$ for every $\phi \in \Ga$.
        Hence for all $\al \in I$ and for all $\phi \in \al$, $p \in [\phi]_T$
        and the intersection of $C$ is non-empty.
\end{itemize}\end{proof}

The Stone space is meant to have a geometric interpretation as 
\linkto{prime_spec_zariski_top}{$\spec(\MM[x_1,\dots,x_n])$}%?%?
when $\MM$ is an algebraically closed field.

\subsection{Types on structures}
\begin{dfn}[Realisation]
    Let $\MM$ be a $\Si$-structure and $A \subs {\MM}$.
    Let $p$ be a subset of $F(\Si(A),n)$
    (we will often be considering the $n$-types on $\eldiag{\Si}{\MM}$,
    a special case of this where $A = {\MM}$).
    Let $\NN$ be a $\Si(A)$-structure.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p$ is realised in $\NN$ by $a \in {\NN}^n$ over $A$ if
            \[\NN \model{\Si(A)} p(a)\]
            We also just say $p$ is realised in $\NN$.
            If $p$ is not realised in $\NN$
            then we say $\NN$ omits $p$.
        \item $p$ is finitely realised in $\NN$ 
            over $A$ if for each finite subset $\De \subs p$ 
            there exists $a \in {\NN}^n$
            such that $\De$ is realised in $\MM$ by $a$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{dfn}

\begin{lem}[Finite realisation and embeddings]
    \link{finite_realisation_and_embeddings}
    Let $\MM$ be a $\Si$-structure, 
    $A$ a subset of ${\MM}$ and $p$ a subset of $F(\Si(A),n)$.
    Then the following are equivalent 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $p$ is consistent with $\eldiag{\Si}{\MM}$ 
            (i.e. it is an $n$-type over $\eldiag{\Si}{\MM}$).
        \item There exists an elementary embedding $\MM \to \NN$ 
            such that $p$ is realised in $\NN$.
        \item There exists an elementary embedding $\MM \to \NN$ 
            such that $p$ is finitely realised in $\NN$.
        \item $p$ is finitely realised in $\MM$.
    \end{itemize}
    The elementary embeddings can be seen as both $\Si$-embeddings or 
    $\Si(A)$-embeddings for any subset $A \subs \MM$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
    $(1. \implies 2.)$ There exists $\NN$ and a
    $b \in {\NN}^n$ such that 
    $\NN \model{\Si(\MM)} \eldiag{\Si}{\MM}$ and 
    $\NN \model{\Si(\MM)} p(b)$.
    Then since \linkto{elem_ext_equiv_eldiag_model}{models of the 
    elementary diagram correspond to elementary extensions}, 
    there exists an elementary $\Si(\MM)$-embedding $\MM \to \NN$ 
    and $b \in {\NN}^n$ such that $p$ 
    is realised by $b$ in $\NN$.
    (This can be moved down to being a $\Si(A)$-embedding for any 
    subset $A \subs \MM$.)

    $(2. \implies 3.)$ Let $\De \subs p$ be finite.
    Then for the same embedding into $\NN$ we can see that $\De$ 
    is realised by $b$ in $\NN$.

    $(3. \implies 4.)$ Let $\De \subs p$ be finite.
    Then by assumption there exists an elementary $\Si$-embedding 
    $\io : \MM \to \NN$ and $b \in {\NN}^n$ 
    such that  
    $\NN \model{\Si} \De(b)$. 
    Hence 
    \[\NN \modelsi \exists v, \bigand{\psi \in \De}{} \psi(v)\]
    where $v$ represents the free variables in $\De$.
    By the embedding being elementary we have 
    \[\MM \modelsi \exists v, \bigand{\psi \in \De}{} \psi(v)\]
    Hence there exists $a \in \MM^\star$ which will realise $\De$.

    $(4. \implies 1.)$
        By \linkto{compactness_for_types}{compactness for types},
        it suffices to show that $p$ 
        is finitely consistent with the elementary diagram.
        Let $\De \subs p$ be finite.
        Then by assumption there is $a \in {\MM}^n$ such that 
        $\MM \model{\Si} \De(a)$ and so $\MM \model{\Si(\MM)} \De(a)$.
        Clearly $\MM$ is a model of its elementary diagram.
\end{proof}

\begin{dfn}[Type of an element]
    Let $\MM$ be a $\Si$-structure containing
    $A \subs {\MM}$ and $a \in {\MM}^n$
    Then 
    \[\subintp{A,n}{\MM}{\tp}(a) := 
    \set{\phi \in F(\Si(A),n) \st \MM \model{\Si(A)} \phi(a)}\]
    is the type of $a$ in $\MM$ over $A$.
    One can verify that this is a maximal $n$-type on $T$
    if $\MM$ is a model of $T$.
\end{dfn}

\begin{prop}[Elements of the Stone space are types of elements]
    \link{elems_of_stone_space_are_types_of_elements}
    Let $\MM$ be a $\Si$-structure,
    $A$ a subset of ${\MM}$ and $p$ a subset of $F(\Si(A),n)$.
    Let $a \in {\MM}^n$.
    Then \begin{itemize}
        \item $p$ is a maximal $n$-type on $\eldiag{\Si}{\MM}$ 
            that is realised by $a \in {\MM}^n$ 
            if and only if $p = \subintp{A,n}{\MM}{\tp}(a)$.
            Hence elements of the Stone space of $\eldiag{\Si}{\MM}$
            are types of elements.
        \item If $\MM \subs \NN$ is an elementary embedding then
            \[\subintp{A,n}{\MM}{\tp}(a) = \subintp{A,n}{\NN}{\tp}(a)\]
    \end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}~\begin{itemize}
    \item \begin{forward}
        As $p$ is realised by $a$, 
        $p \subs \subintp{A,n}{\MM}{\tp}(a)$.
        By maximality of $p$ any formula in $\subintp{A,n}{\MM}{\tp}(a)$ 
        is either in $p$
        or its negation is in $p$.
        If its negation is in 
        $p \subs \subintp{A,n}{\MM}{\tp}(a)$ 
        then $\MM \model{\Si(A)} \phi(a)$ and
        $\MM \nodel{\Si(A)} \phi(a)$, a contradiction.
    \end{forward}
    \begin{backward}
        If $p = \subintp{A,n}{\MM}{\tp}(a)$ 
        then clearly $p$ is realised by $a$ and so it is consistent with 
        $\eldiag{\Si}{\MM}$ thus it is an $n$-type over $\eldiag{\Si}{\MM}$.
        For any $\phi \in F(\Si(A),n)$,
        $\MM \model{\Si(A)} \phi(a)$ or $\MM \nodel{\Si(A)} \phi(a)$.
        Hence $\phi$ or $\NOT \phi$ is in $p$ and so it is maximal.
    \end{backward}
    \item \[\phi \in \subintp{A,n}{\MM}{\tp}(a) \iff \MM \model{\Si(A)} \phi(a)
        \iff \NN \model{\Si(A)} \phi(a) \iff 
        \phi \in \subintp{A,n}{\NN}{\tp}(a)\]
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
